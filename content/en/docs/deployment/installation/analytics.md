## Install the Analytics Helm chart

   ```bash
   kubectl create namespace open-banking-analytics
   ```

2. Install the Analytics Helm charts:

   ```bash
   helm install analytics open-banking-analytics -n open-banking-analytics
   ```

3. Check that the status of the Helm command is deployed:

   ```
   NAME: analytics 
   LAST DEPLOYED: <current date and time>
   NAMESPACE: open-banking-analytics 
   STATUS: deployed
   REVISION: 1 
   TEST SUITE: None
   ```

## Verify the Analytics Helm chart deployment

1. Wait a few minutes and use the following commands to check the deployment status.

   ```
   kubectl get pods -n open-banking-analytics 
   ```

   ```
       NAME                           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
       elasticsearch-master-0         1/1     Running   0          57s
       elasticsearch-master-1         1/1     Running   0          57s
       elasticsearch-master-2         1/1     Running   0          57s
       kibana-647679fd47-btnt6        1/1     Running   0          57s
       logstash-0                     1/1     Running   0          57s
       metrics-apis-8684c7594-8p46b   1/1     Running   0          52s
       webserver-5d59fc5447-gvnmk     1/1     Running   0          50s
   ```

2. Verify that:
   * **pods** with name elasticsearch-master-x, logstash-portal-x, kibana-xxx-xxx, metrics-apis-xxx-xxx, webserver-xxx-xxx are **Running** and Restart is **0**.

3. Check ingress with this command:

   ```bash
   kubectl get ingress -n open-banking-analytics 
   ```

4. Verify that these ingress are provisioned. They must have a public ip or a dns value in the ADDRESS column.

   ```
    NAME         HOSTS                           ADDRESS                       PORTS     AGE
    kibana       kibana.<domain-name>            xxxxxxxxxxxxx.amazonaws.com   80, 443   2m
    webserver    analytics.<domain-name>         xxxxxxxxxxxxx.amazonaws.com   80, 443   2m
   ```

5. Check that you can access the different user interfaces:
   * *Analytics homepage*: `https://webserver.<domain-name>`
      * The Dashboard and Reports navigation (top bar) should show up with the custom logo and color theme.
      * No dashboard is deployed yet.
   * *ELK admin interface*: `https://kibana.<domain-name>`
      * You should be able to login with the credentials provided in the Helm chart values.

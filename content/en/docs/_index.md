This is a placeholder page that shows you how to use this template site.
{{% /pageinfo %}}

This section is where the user documentation for your project lives - all the information your users need to understand and successfully use your project.

For large documentation sets we recommend adding content under the headings in this section, though if some or all of them donâ€™t apply to your project feel free to remove them or add your own.

## Introducing Open Banking

Open banking is a global phenomenon. Demand for digital experiences, competition from technology firms, and rising regulatory pressures are forcing banks to rethink existing business models. Open banking is about banks sharing financial information, with each other and with third parties, in a simple, secure and transparent way. It helps put consumers back in control of their financial data to help them better understand and manage their money, across as many providers as they need. Open banking enables broad integration across the entire financial ecosystem, ultimately leading to new and innovative banking products which are faster, cheaper, and more adaptable to our rapidly changing world.

Traditionally, banking was confined to a closed ecosystem with data access in silos and limited data sharing with the customer. Consequently, the services and products offered were unique to the institution. With the leap in technology and evolution of the shared ecosystem, the wave of open banking is gaining prominence and thereby enabling financial institutions to provide more value to customers. This entails providing personalized services, through a shared ecosystem with customer consent and thereby, unlocking the huge potential for open banking.

Open banking can be defined as an ecosystem that furnishes the end user with data from a myriad of financial institutions by application programming interfaces (APIs). APIs help a software or application (app) to communicate and work with another application and seamlessly share information. Open Banking APIs allow third parties to securely access banking or financial information data in real-time, enabling them to integrate their respective systems, processing the data and offering more valuable insights and services, and powering the digital experiences of tomorrow.

This page provides a guide to complying with the for Open Banking Brazil standards, covering Phases 1 to 3.

## Checklist

The table below provides the checklist of standards and guides that we need to comply with through the Axway Open Banking solution.

| #   | Name | Phase | Guidance | Links | URI(s) |
| --: | ---- | ----- | -------- | ----- | ------ |
|  1 | Publication of Endpoints | 1 | Outlines the requirement for participants to publish their endpoints for their Phase 1 APIs.<br><br>Participants must accurate record metadata relating to their installation in the Participants register. | [Instructions (in Portuguese)](https://ob-public-files.s3.amazonaws.com/open_banking_endpoints.pdf?cookie=true)<br>[Open Banking Brazil Directory](https://web.directory.openbankingbrasil.org.br/) | N/A |
|  2 | Customer Experience Guidelines | All | Outlines the customer experience guidelines for Open Banking. Of particular note: <ul><li>The requirements for banks confirming the consent agreed between the Consumer and the Third-Party Provider (TPP) for sharing data is at page 86 to 104.</li><li>The equivalent requirements for payments is at page 133 to 183.</li></ul>Note that there are also standards around "[Error Cases](https://openbanking-brasil.github.io/areadesenvolvedor/#casos-de-erro)" that detail unhappy paths around Consent redirection.<br><br>Axway Open Banking provides a consent page template, which is white-labelled and can modified according to customer requirements.<br><br>Customers can choose to engineer their own consent page and call our API in the background. | [Document (in Portuguese)](https://openbanking-brasil.github.io/areadesenvolvedor/documents/GuiaDeExperienciaDoUsuarioCompartilhamentoDeDadosEIniciacaoDePagamento_v3.03.02.pdf) |  N/A |
|  3 | API Standards | All | This section of the standards describe the principles by which the APIs are engineered and they transpose into the design standards.<br>In the sense of compliance these standards should be self-enforcing as the OpenAPI documents have been engineered accordingly.<br>However, given the fact that these documents are not always consistent it is useful to be aware of these standards.<br><br>Adopting the API standards is a given as Axway implements the OpenAPI documents provided by Open Banking Brazil. | [Open Banking Brazil Portal](https://openbanking-brasil.github.io/areadesenvolvedor/#padroes) | N/A |
|  4 | Non-Functional Requirements | All | This section of the standards details the non-functional requirements (NFRs) expected of the API provider. These include:<br><ul><li>SLAs.</li><li>Availability (via the Status API).</li><li>Performance (according to the "tier" an API belongs to).</li><li>Rate-limits/thresholds.</li></ul>Please refer to this section of the standards for specific details.<br><br>Axway is acting as a "facilitator" of meeting the NFRs as the performance and behaviour of the APIs will be heavily influence by the backend systems the solution is connected to. | [Standards](https://openbanking-brasil.github.io/areadesenvolvedor/#requisitos-nao-funcionais) | N/A |
|  5 | Dynamic Client Registration (DCR) | 2+ |  DCR is required to allow TPPs to register with banks programmatically i.e. without the need to visit a developer portal, register as either an individual or an organization and create an application thereafter.<br>The DCR profile for Open Banking Brazil introduces a flow ([Portuguese](https://openbanking-brasil.github.io/specs-seguranca/open-banking-brasil-dynamic-client-registration-1_ID1-ptbr.html#name-processamento-de-solicita23) and [English](https://openbanking-brasil.github.io/specs-seguranca/open-banking-brasil-dynamic-client-registration-1_ID1.html#name-dynamic-client-registration)) that involves a number of steps:<ul><li>TPPs start by calling the Open Banking Brazil Directory Authorization Server (AS) through OAuth using Mutual Authentication+TLS and eliciting an Access Token.</li><li>With the Access Token in-hand they call the Directory API to retrieve the AS for the bank they wish to enrol with.</li><li>They then call the Bank AS and retrieve their OpenID configuration.</li><li>The TPP will then request a Software Statement Assertion from the Directory API. This is returned as a JSON Web Signature.</li><li>The SSA is then transmitted to the Bank AS which verifies it using the Directory JSON Web Key Set (JWKS). On successful registration the Bank AS issues both Client Credentials and a "Management Token" (see [here](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7592#appendix-A) for definition of Management Token) to the Client.</li></ul>Note that this flow dictates that Bank AS must call both ICP (to verify the TPP client certificate) and the Directory (to retrieve the JWKS to verify the JWS of the SSA).<br><br>DCR is only required from Phase 2 onwards as Phase 1 only requires the implementation open data APIs that do not require authentication (and therefore absolve a TPP of the need to register for access). | [Specification (in Portuguese)](https://openbanking-brasil.github.io/specs-seguranca/open-banking-brasil-dynamic-client-registration-1_ID1-ptbr.html)<br>[Specification (in English)](https://openbanking-brasil.github.io/specs-seguranca/open-banking-brasil-dynamic-client-registration-1_ID1.html) | N/A |
|  6 | API Security Profile | 2+ |  The API Security Profile for Open Banking Brazil takes the [FAPI Advanced Security Profile](https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2-1_0.html) and implements further controls that reduce the possible attack vectors. These measures include:<ul><li>Support for signed and encrypted Request parameter objects, used in the initiation of Authorization Code flow where an End User authenticates and confirms the consent they provided to the TPP.</li><li>Support for Pushed Authorization Requests (PAR) that allow Request parameter objects to be transmitted securely via a backchannel.</li><li>Implementing a number of standard OpenID Connect (OIDC) claims such as "cpf" and "cnpj".</li><li>Ensuring various optional features of OIDC and OAuth 2.0 are mandatory, such as Discovery, the Userinfo endpoint and Refresh Tokens.</li><li>Tightening of various other aspects of Advanced Profile include limiting the algorithm for JWS to PS256.</li><li>Mandating Client-Initiated Backchannel Authentication (CIBA) for any Client providing payments services (and therefore supporting the payments scope).</li></ul>The Profile also includes a definition for implementing Dynamic Scopes.<br><br>Compliance with the Security Profile must be proven through the test suite detailed in the [Testing and Approval](https://openbanking-brasil.github.io/areadesenvolvedor/#diretrizes-gerais) section of the Open Banking Brazil standards. |[Profile (in Portuguese)](https://openbanking-brasil.github.io/specs-seguranca/open-banking-brasil-financial-api-1_ID2-ptbr.html)<br>[Profile (in English)](https://openbanking-brasil.github.io/specs-seguranca/open-banking-brasil-financial-api-1_ID2.html) | N/A |
|  7 | Certificate Standard | 1+ | The Certificate Standard defines constraints for both client and server certificates that are used by either party in the operation of the open banking ecosystem in Brazil.<br>Note that at Phase 1 there appears to be no mechanism to test compliance with this standard i.e. as all the APIs are open unfettered access appears to be the only compliance test. | [Standards (in English)](https://openbanking-brasil.github.io/specs-seguranca/open-banking-brasil-certificate-standards-1_ID1.html) | N/A |
|  8 | Status API | 1+ |  Provides the status of the APIs hosted by the bank.<br>This is an open data API and requires no authentication for access. It is rate-limited at the thresholds described in the standards.<br>The [non-functional requirements section](https://openbanking-brasil.github.io/areadesenvolvedor/#requisitos-nao-funcionais) of the standards also outlines requirements for the Status API. Please refer to this section for up-to-date details.<br><br>It is assumed that this API must be implemented regardless of whether the implementor starts later than Phase 1 | [Standards](https://openbanking-brasil.github.io/areadesenvolvedor/#api-de-status)<br>[OpenAPI document](https://openbanking-brasil.github.io/areadesenvolvedor/swagger/swagger_common_apis.yaml) |  /discovery/v1/status |
|  9 | Outages API | 1+ | Provides information on outages at the the bank.<br>This is an open data API and requires no authentication for access. It is rate-limited at the thresholds described in the standards.<br><br>It is assumed that this API must be implemented regardless of whether the implementor starts later than Phase 1 | [Standards](https://openbanking-brasil.github.io/areadesenvolvedor/#api-de-outages)<br>[OpenAPI document](https://openbanking-brasil.github.io/areadesenvolvedor/swagger/swagger_common_apis.yaml) |  /discovery/v1/outages |

It is rate-limited at the thresholds described in the standards. | [Standards](https://openbanking-brasil.github.io/areadesenvolvedor/#api-canais-de-atendimento)<br>[OpenAPI document](https://openbanking-brasil.github.io/areadesenvolvedor/swagger/swagger_channels_apis.yaml) |  /channels/v1/branches<br> /channels/v1/electronic-channels<br> /channels/v1/phone-channels<br> /channels/v1/banking-agents<br> /channels/v1/shared-automated-teller-machines |
| 11 | Products and Services API | 1 |  Provides information on personal and business products across a range of product types including:<ul><li>Current accounts.</li><li>Loans.</li><li>Financing.</li><li>Invoice financing.</li><li>Credit cards.</li><li>Unarranged overdrafts.</li></ul>This is an open data API and requires no authentication for access. It is rate-limited at the thresholds described in the standards. | [Standards](https://openbanking-brasil.github.io/areadesenvolvedor/#api-produtos-e-servicos)<br>[OpenAPI document](https://openbanking-brasil.github.io/areadesenvolvedor/swagger/swagger_products_services_apis.yaml) |  /products-services/v1/personal-accounts<br> /products-services/v1/business-accounts<br> /products-services/v1/personal-loans<br> /products-services/v1/business-loans<br> /products-services/v1/personal-financings<br> /products-services/v1/business-financings<br> /products-services/v1/personal-invoice-financings<br> /products-services/v1/business-invoice-financings<br> /products-services/v1/personal-credit-cards<br> /products-services/v1/business-credit-cards<br> /products-services/v1/personal-unarranged-account-overdraft<br> /products-services/v1/business-unarranged-account-overdraft |
| 12 | Metrics API | 1+ | Provides metrics data for consumption by the Directory.<br>This is an open data API and requires no authentication for access. It is rate-limited at the thresholds described in the standards.<br><br>It is assumed that this API must be implemented regardless of whether the implementor starts later than Phase 1 | [Standards](https://openbanking-brasil.github.io/areadesenvolvedor/#api-admin)<br>[OpenAPI document](https://openbanking-brasil.github.io/areadesenvolvedor/swagger/swagger_admin_apis.yaml) |  /admin/v1/metrics |
| 13 | Consent API | 2 | Provides the implementation of the Lodging Intent pattern that allows a TPP to create and maintain consent at the bank.<br>It covers all Phase 2 APIs, with one-or-more permission codes per API defined in the OpenAPI document. | [Standards](https://openbanking-brasil.github.io/areadesenvolvedor/#fase-2-apis-do-open-banking-brasil-api-consentimento)<br>[OpenAPI document](https://openbanking-brasil.github.io/areadesenvolvedor/swagger/swagger_consents_apis.yaml) |  /consents/v1/consents<br> /consents/v1/consents/{consentId} |
| 14 | Resources API | 2 |  The Resources API creates a bridge between the consent granted by an End User and the accounts they hold and have agreed to share.<br>It is used by a TPP to retrieve the accounts - regardless of type - that the End User has agreed to share. Each Account ID is shared with its type and the status of the account.<br>Note that one of the status codes - `PENDING_AUTHORISATION` - is unlikely to ever be returned where only a single End User is required to consent to access.<br>Customer consent is required for a TPP to access this API and retrieve a customer's data. | [Standards](https://openbanking-brasil.github.io/areadesenvolvedor/#fase-2-apis-do-open-banking-brasil-api-resources)<br>[OpenAPI document](https://openbanking-brasil.github.io/areadesenvolvedor/swagger/swagger_resources_apis.yaml) |  /resources/v1/resources |
| 15 | Customer API | 2 | The Customer API provides information on the customer who provided consent or the organization, depending on whether the customer is a personal or business customer.<br>The endpoints support the retrieval of the following data:<br><ul><li>The identity of the customer including their legal identifier, social security number (where applicable) and address.</li><li>Financial "qualification" records, namely their income. In the case of businesses this includes information on their economic activities.</li><li>Any information on the customer's financial relationships, namely the products and services they hold.</li></ul>Customer consent is required for a TPP to access this API and retrieve a customer's data. | [Standards](https://openbanking-brasil.github.io/areadesenvolvedor/#fase-2-apis-do-open-banking-brasil-api-dados-cadastrais)<br>[OpenAPI document](https://openbanking-brasil.github.io/areadesenvolvedor/swagger/swagger_customers_apis.yaml) |  /customers/v1/personal/identifications<br> /customers/v1/business/identifications<br> /customers/v1/personal/qualifications<br> /customers/v1/business/qualifications<br> /customers/v1/personal/financial-relations<br> /customers/v1/business/financial-relations |

| 22 | Payments API | 3 | The Payments API is the core deliverable for Phase 3 of Open Banking Brazil. It incorporates two operations:<ul><li>The creation of consent for a single immediate payment.</li><li>The execution of the payment instruction once consent is authorized.</li></ul>The payment instruction itself will be transmitted using PIX. It therefore relies on attributes from the PIX payment set-up method e.g. QR Code made available to the payer, PIX "key" of the payee.<br><br>Note that according to the [API Security Profile for Brazil](https://openbanking-brasil.github.io/specs-seguranca/open-banking-brasil-financial-api-1_ID2-ptbr.html) CIBA **must** be supported for any participant supporting the scope payments. | [Standards](https://openbanking-brasil.github.io/areadesenvolvedor/#fase-3-apis-do-open-banking-brasil-api-pagamentos)<br>[OpenAPI document](https://openbanking-brasil.github.io/areadesenvolvedor/swagger/swagger_payments_apis.yaml) | /payments/v1/consents<br> /payments/v1/consents/{consentId}<br> /payments/v1/pix/payments<br> /payments/v1/pix/payments/{paymentId} |

The ReadMeFirst team of technical writers based in Dublin is proud to announce the beta availability of docs-as-code for AMPLIFY Central and API Portal documentation. In other words, this documentation is now open source and everyone can collaborate and improve it using what's commonly known as a docs-as-code workflow, where docs are:

* written in a simple Markdown format
* stored in GitHub
* anyone can edit them by submitting a pull request
* technical writers review and publish the changes to the production website.

All updates to the docs are published to the Axway production portal - <https://docs.axway.com/>

## Ways to collaborate

Open source docs is a growing trend. Other big companies such as Docker, Amazon, and Microsoft have opened their documentation for collaboration using a GitHub forking and pull request workflow.

In Axway, ReadMeFirst team implemented the GitHub workflow and, thinking of non-technical users, who perhaps don't have knowledge of GitHub or Markdown, we also implemented a Netlify content management system (CMS) workflow, which allows you to edit a page on a WYSIWYG editor.

## Axway Open Documentation website

The open source docs are available at <https://axway-open-docs.netlify.com/,> this is your one-stop source to browse and edit API product documentation.

If you find anything to be fixed or improved on a page, you can edit it directly instead of creating Issues, to speed up the process of updating the doc. A technical writer will review your edits, then publish the updated documentation to <https://docs.axway.com.>

Please read the [Contribution guidelines](/docs/contribution_guidelines/) to learn more about how to improve Axway docs, and let us know your feedback or if you have any questions.

## Coming soon

ReadMeFirst team is currently working on migrating the API Gateway and API Manager content to this workflow, and we will be continually improving the new process based on your feedback.

Thanks a lot!

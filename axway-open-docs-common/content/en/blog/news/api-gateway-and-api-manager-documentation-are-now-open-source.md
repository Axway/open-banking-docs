We are very excited to announce the availability of the latest version of API Gateway and API Manager documentation in our open source docs-as-code workflow! Following on from [Open source documentation is here for AMPLIFY Central and API Portal](/blog/2019/09/18/open-source-documentation-is-here-for-amplify-central-and-api-portal/) we have now migrated all of the API Gateway and API Manager content as well (except for a few low priority guides which will follow later).

## What does this mean for you?

Anyone can now propose changes to any topic in the AMPLIFY API Management or AMPLIFY Central documentation using a quick and easy process. All you need is a [GitHub](https://github.com/join) account.

To get started go to [Documentation](/docs/).

Here's a short animation demonstrating how to make and preview a change with Netlify CMS:

The CMS also allows you to make further updates after sending the changes for review (for example, to clarify something or to add something you forgot). It's also the easiest way to add a new topic within an existing section.

For those who have Markdown skills and prefer to use GitHub UI, this option is also provided via an Edit on Github button on each page of the documentation.  Of course, if you are a Git expert you can also use Git CLI to fork the Axway GitHub repo and submit a pull request. The choice is yours :)

See the [Contribution guidelines](/docs/contribution_guidelines/) for full details.

## Types of improvements you can make

Here are just some ideas for the types of improvements you can make to the documentation:

* Do you have examples of use cases or other examples that could be added to the documentation? We often receive feedback that our documentation does not contain enough examples or real-life use cases.
* Maybe you have a step-by-step tutorial that you've prepared and that could help users get up and running with our products? Tutorials are especially useful for showing beginners what they can do with a product.
* Do you have any video demos that are published on Axway YouTube channels. You can very quickly embed links to those videos to the appropriate topics in the docs.
* Have you come across some procedures in the documentation that are unclear or confusing? Or that have missing steps or missing information? Do you have the product knowledge to make them clearer and easier for users to understand?
* Have you spotted small typos and inaccuracies when using the documentation in the past? If you spot one from now on, please take a few minutes to either report it or propose a fix yourself using the **Edit** options on every page.

Happy contributing :)

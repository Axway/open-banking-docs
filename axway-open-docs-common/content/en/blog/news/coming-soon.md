The ReadMeFirst team of technical writers based in Dublin are currently working on a solution known as 'docs-as-code' that will enable everyone in Axway with useful product knowledge to edit the documentation for API Management and AMPLIFY Central products directly.

We aim to have the first phase of documentation content open for edits in just a few weeks! Subscribe to this blog to be notified as soon as we go live!

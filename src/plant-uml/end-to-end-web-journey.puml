Overview
===
This diagram shows the end-to-end web journey for obtaining Consent and starting to collect
Account Information data. The goal is to place the components from the Architecture Overview
in context.
|||
Note this diagram shows the means for the Client to authenticate at the Authorization Server
as mutual authentication but this could equally be done using ""private_key_jwt"".
end note

== Part 1: TPP Obtains Customer Consent ==

note right of PSU
Obtaining Consent from the Customer is usually outside the scope of technical standards. The
Customer Experience Guidelines in Brazil informs how Consent should be displayed and obtained.
|||
The specifics of this process are therefore not shown here. The Third-Party Provider (TPP) is
assumed to have implemented this within the guidelines specified.
end note

PSU -> TPP: Indicate wish to share data
PSU <-- TPP: Display "Intent"\ni.e. data to be accessed\nor payment to be made
PSU -> TPP: Confirm intent
PSU <-- TPP: Show bank selection screen
PSU -> TPP: Confirm bank selection

== Part 2: TPP Creates and Lodges "Intent" ==

note right of TPP
With the consent of the Consumer obtained the TPP can now call the Authorization Control Plane
(ACP) API at the correct bank. Note at this point Consent is usual termed "Intent" as it has
yet to confirmed at the bank.
end note

TPP -> TPP: Create Intent payload

note right of TPP
Given the adherence to OpenID Connect Discovery in the standards TPPs are expected to collect
OpenID Configuration information from participating banks.
end note

alt TPP has cached OpenID Configuration for bank 

note right of TPP
Do nothing
end note

else TPP retrieves OpenID Configuration for bank

TPP -> OBD_PARTICIPANTS: Get List of Participants
TPP <-- OBD_PARTICIPANTS: Response

note right of TPP
The discovery endpoint value is stored in the ""OpenIDDiscoveryDocument"" property of the banks
entry in the list
end note

TPP -> TPP: Get Discovery endpoint for target bank

note right of TPP
The OpenID Configuration is hosted at Authorization Control Plane (ACP) API. This is an open URL
that does not require authentication.
end note

TPP -> INGRESS: ""GET /.well-known/openid-configuation""
INGRESS -> API_GATEWAY: ""GET /.well-known/openid-configuation""
API_GATEWAY -> CONSENT: ""GET /.well-known/openid-configuation""
API_GATEWAY <-- CONSENT: ""200 OK {...}""
INGRESS <-- API_GATEWAY: ""200 OK {...}""
TPP <-- INGRESS: ""200 OK {...}""

end alt

TPP -> TPP: Lookup Token endpoint\nfrom OpenID Configuration

note right of TPP
The TPP then uses the Client Credentials grant to obtain an Access Token to then
lodge the Consent on behalf of the Consumer.
|||
These request will be made using Mutual TLS with a certificate signed by a 
Certificate Authority whose certificate chain resolves at the Brazil ICP CA.
|||
The Kubernetes Ingress Controller is responsible for TLS termination and performing
an OCSP call to the Certificate Authority to ensure the client certificate presented
is valid. The fingerprint of the certificate will be forwarded to Identity Management
to verify the validity of the OAuth Client as this cannot be asserted via OCSP.
|||
It should be noted that due to the adoption of the Mutual TLS profile for OAuth 2.0 in
FAPI [[https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-oauth-mtls-08.html (here)]] many Authorization Servers will bind Access Tokens to the
client certificate presented when they were created. This is indicated in the OpenID Configuration
through by the value of the ""tls_client_certificate_bound_access_tokens"" property.
end note

TPP -> INGRESS: ""POST /oauth2/token""
INGRESS -> OCSP: Check Client Certificate Validity
INGRESS <-- OCSP: Response
INGRESS -> API_GATEWAY: ""POST /oauth2/token""
API_GATEWAY -> IAM: ""POST /oauth2/token""

API_GATEWAY <- IAM: ""200 OK""\n""{"access_token": "..."}""
INGRESS <-- API_GATEWAY: ""200 OK""\n""{"access_token": "..."}""
TPP <-- INGRESS: ""200 OK""\n""{"access_token": "..."}""

alt TPP requires access to account for data

note right of TPP
**Account Information**
---
TPPs use a generic endpoint for Account Information that covers all
account types (checking, credit card, loans, etc).
end note

TPP -> INGRESS: ""POST /consents/v1/consents""
INGRESS -> OCSP: Check Client Certificate Validity
INGRESS <-- OCSP: Response
INGRESS -> API_GATEWAY: ""POST /consents/v1/consents""

else TPP requires access to account to initiate payment

note right of TPP
**Payment Initiation**
---
Payment Initiation has a dedicated endpoint that will be used
to cover all payment rails (PIX, TED, etc).
end note

TPP -> INGRESS: ""POST /payments/v1/consents""
INGRESS -> OCSP: Check Client Certificate Validity
INGRESS <-- OCSP: Response
INGRESS -> API_GATEWAY: ""POST /payments/v1/consents""

end alt

API_GATEWAY -> CONSENT: Introspect Access Token
CONSENT -> CONSENT: Retrieve Access Token properties
API_GATEWAY <-- CONSENT: Response
API_GATEWAY -> API_GATEWAY: Verify Access Token scope

note right of API_GATEWAY
The ACP API provides separate operations based on the type of consent i.e.
account information, payments, etc. The API Gateway mediates the request and
calls the operation appropriate to the consent in question.
end note

alt Account Information
API_GATEWAY -> CONSENT: ""POST /consents/v1/consents""
else Payment Initation
API_GATEWAY -> CONSENT: ""POST /payments/v1/consents""
end alt

API_GATEWAY <-- CONSENT: ""201 Created""\n""{"consentId": "..."}""
API_GATEWAY -> API_GATEWAY: Format response
INGRESS <-- API_GATEWAY: ""201 Created""\n""{"consentId": "..."}"" 
TPP <-- INGRESS: ""201 Created""\n""{"consentId": "..."}"" 

== Part 3: Customer is Redirected to Authorization Server ==

note right of TPP
**API Security Profile**
---
FAPI mandates the use of the [[https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2-ID2.html#authorization-server Authentication Request object]] which is defined in [[https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#JWTRequests Section 6]]
of OpenID Connect Core. This is a JSON Web Signature that contains parameters
normally found in the URL (redirect_uri, state, scope, etc)
|||
However, FAPI has been extended by the [[https://openbanking-brasil.github.io/specs-seguranca/open-banking-brasil-financial-api-1_ID2.html API Security Profile for Brazil]] where 2
alternatives are added to the Authorization Server (AS) in terms of Request parameter
support:
|||
1. Request parameter passed in the URI that must be **signed and encrypted**.
2. Request parameter passed by reference through [[https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-par Pushed Authorization Requests (PAR)]].
|||
Support for either approach should be included in the OpenID Configuration available
through Discovery that banks are obliged to provide under the API Security Profile.
Both options are shown in the sequence diagram.
|||
**Note that Amplify Open Banking will initially support the first approach, namely a signed**
**and encrypted JSON Web Token and introduce support for PAR in a later release.**
end note

TPP -> TPP: Create Request parameter

' alt AS supports Request parameter passed by value

note right of TPP
The Signing and Encryption keys will be the private part of the pair signed by the Directory
that can be referenced in the JSON Web Key Set maintained therein i.e. the key ID matches
one of the TPPs JSON Web Keys.
end note

TPP -> TPP: Sign Request parameter with Signing Key
TPP -> TPP: Encrypt Request parameter with Encryption Key
TPP -> TPP: Create redirect URL including Request parameter

' else AS supports PAR

' note right of TPP
' To create an Authorization request through PAR the TPP **must** authenticate using the same
' method as they use at the Token endpoint.
' end note

' TPP -> TPP: Encode Request parameter in payload
' TPP -> INGRESS: ""POST /par""
' INGRESS -> OCSP: Check Client Certificate Validity
' INGRESS <-- OCSP: Response
' INGRESS -> API_GATEWAY: ""POST /par""
' API_GATEWAY -> IAM: Authorization request
' API_GATEWAY <-- IAM: Response
' INGRESS <-- API_GATEWAY: ""201 Created""\n""{"request_uri": "..."}"" 
' TPP <-- INGRESS: ""201 Created""\n""{"request_uri": "..."}"" 
' TPP -> TPP: Create redirect URL including ""request_uri"" value

' end alt

PSU <-- TPP: Redirect customer
PSU -> API_GATEWAY: ""GET /oauth2/authorize?...""

note right of API_GATEWAY
This is indicative as the Directory JWKS is likely to be cached for a
period time i.e. the JWKS will not be retrieved on every Authentication
Request.
|||
Note that this implementation is intended to provide strength-in-depth
i.e. the API Gateway can verify the JSON Web Signature before handing
off to Identity Management, therefore protecting it from unnecessary
unsolicited requests.
end note

API_GATEWAY -> OBD_JWKS: Get JSON Web Key Set
API_GATEWAY <-- OBD_JWKS: Response
API_GATEWAY -> API_GATEWAY: Match Request parameter ""kid""
API_GATEWAY -> API_GATEWAY: Verify Request parameter signature
API_GATEWAY -> IAM: Forward Request parameter
IAM -> IAM: Verify Request parameter
IAM -> CONSENT: Request Consent by ID
CONSENT -> CONSENT: Retrieve Consent
IAM <- CONSENT: Response
API_GATEWAY <- IAM: Return redirect URL

== Part 4: Customer Authenticates and Authorizes Consent ==

note right of PSU
The following steps can vary according the bank's requirements
for authentication and authorization but these steps provide
an accurate overview in the context of the Amplify Open Banking.
end note

PSU <-- API_GATEWAY: Redirect Customer
PSU -> ASPSP_WEB: Follow Redirect
ASPSP_WEB -> ASPSP_WEB: Verify redirect

loop Request required number of authentication factors

note right of PSU
This loop is intended to be indicative and the actual
mechanics are entirely dependent on the bank's
implementation and their approach to user experience.
end note

PSU <-- ASPSP_WEB: Serve credentials input page
PSU -> ASPSP_WEB: Submit credentials
ASPSP_WEB -> ASPSP_WEB: Verify credentials

end loop

note right of INGRESS
**Providing security for the ACP API should be reviewed on a case-by-case
**basis and implemented according to customer requirements.**
|||
This diagram shows an example of access to the Consent Management API
being implemented via the Ingress Controller/API Gateway. Security
is provided via an internal certificate which is **not** validated
against ICP.
|||
The ""{operation}"" parameter denotes either an Account Information or
Payment Initiation consent. The possible values are:

* ""consents"": Account Information
* ""payments"": Payment Initiation

The value of ""{consent-id}"" must be retrieved from the requested scope as
this contains the consent resource identifier as defined in the [[https://openbanking-brasil.github.io/specs-seguranca/open-banking-brasil-financial-api-1_ID2.html#section-7.1.2 Security Profile]].
end note

ASPSP_WEB -> INGRESS: ""GET ​/open-banking​/{operation}/v1/consent/{consent-id}""
INGRESS -> API_GATEWAY: ""GET ​/open-banking​/{operation}/v1/consent/{consent-id}""
API_GATEWAY -> CONSENT: ""GET ​/open-banking​/{operation}/v1/consent/{consent-id}""
CONSENT -> CONSENT: Retrieve "Intent"
API_GATEWAY <-- CONSENT: ""200 OK {...}""
INGRESS <-- API_GATEWAY: ""200 OK {...}""
ASPSP_WEB <-- INGRESS: ""200 OK {...}""

alt Account Information Consent

note right of ASPSP_WEB
**Account Information**
---
When creating the Consent Confirmation screen the
permission codes held in the "Intent" need to be
converted to something that will be meaningful to the
Customer. The wording should adhere to that detailed
in the [[https://github.com/OpenBanking-Brasil/areadesenvolvedor/raw/gh-pages/documents/GuiaDeExperienciaDoUsuarioCompartilhamentoDeDadosEIniciacaoDePagamento_v3.02.03.pdf Customer Experience Guidelines]].
end note

else Payment Initiation Consent

note right of ASPSP_WEB
**Payment Initiation**
---
The Consent Confirmation screen requires the following properties to be displayed:
* Transaction Value.
* Recipient details (name, CPF/CNPJ).
* Payment Date.
* Payment method (currently fixed on PIX).
* Fee amount charged by the bank (if any).
end note

par Request fee amount for payment

note right of ASPSP_WEB
Fees for payment must be provided from the Banking Systems
end note

ASPSP_WEB -> ASPSP_API: Request fee amount
ASPSP_WEB <-- ASPSP_API: Response

else

alt Debtor account not provided in Consent

note right of ASPSP_WEB
If the debtor account has not been provided in the Consent then
the customer's payment accounts will need to be retrieved:

* If the customer only has one payment account then this is the default.
* If they have multiple accounts they should be able to select one.

This should be incorporated into the Consent Confirmation screen.
end note

ASPSP_WEB -> ASPSP_API: Request in-scope payment accounts
ASPSP_WEB <-- ASPSP_API: Response

else Debtor account provided in Consent

note right of ASPSP_WEB
If the debtor account has already been provided ownership of the
account by the customer **must** be verified. This must be executed
at the Banking Systems as they will understand the relationship
between a (now authenticated) customer and the accounts they own.
end note

ASPSP_WEB -> ASPSP_API: Verify account ownership
ASPSP_WEB <-- ASPSP_API: Response

end alt

end par

end alt

ASPSP_WEB -> ASPSP_WEB: Render Consent Confirmation screen
PSU <-- ASPSP_WEB: Serve Consent Confirmation screen
PSU -> ASPSP_WEB: Confirm consent is correct

alt Account Information Consent

note right of ASPSP_WEB
**Account Information**
---
Once consent has been confirmed by the Customer the list of
in-scope accounts will be retrieved from the Banking Systems.
This list will obviously be dictated by the permission codes
requested by the TPP i.e. if only ""ACCOUNTS_READ"" is requested
then all other account types can be ignored.
end note

ASPSP_WEB -> ASPSP_API: Request in-scope Customer accounts
ASPSP_WEB <-- ASPSP_API: Response

ASPSP_WEB -> ASPSP_WEB: Render Account Selection screen
PSU <-- ASPSP_WEB: Serve Account Selection screen
PSU -> ASPSP_WEB: Send Account Selection

end alt

note right of INGRESS
**Payment Initation**
---
The consent is updated with the granted accounts. Note for for Payment
Initiation ""account_ids"" can be omitted.
end note

ASPSP_WEB -> INGRESS: ""POST /open-banking/{operation}/{login}/accept""\n""{ account_ids: [...] }"" 
INGRESS -> API_GATEWAY: ""POST /open-banking/{operation}/{login}/accept""\n""{ account_ids: [...] }"" 
API_GATEWAY -> CONSENT: ""POST /open-banking/{operation}/{login}/accept""\n""{ account_ids: [...] }"" 
CONSENT -> CONSENT: Update "Intent" with Account IDs
CONSENT -> CONSENT: Mark Consent as ""AUTHORISED""

INGRESS <-- API_GATEWAY: ""200 OK {redirect_to: "..."}""
ASPSP_WEB <-- INGRESS: ""200 OK {redirect_to: "..."}""

note right of PSU
The Customer is redirected back to the Amplify Open Banking stack from
the bank's Identity Provider in order to complete Hybrid Flow, using
the value of the ""redirect_uri"" property returned in the response
from the call to the consent API.
|||
The hand-off is constrained using a number of parameters included
in the redirect URI to help safeguard this process i.e. to prevent
unsolicited authentication attempts or session takeover.
end note

PSU <-- ASPSP_WEB: Redirect Customer\nback to API Gateway
PSU -> INGRESS: Follow redirect
INGRESS -> API_GATEWAY: Follow redirect
API_GATEWAY -> IAM: Forward redirect parameters
IAM -> IAM: Verify redirect
IAM -> IAM: Mint Authorization Code\nand ID Token

note right of IAM
At this point the Identity Management module mints a redirect
URI that will take the Customer back to the Third-Party App.
The URI includes the Authorization Code and parameters that
adhere to the API Security Profile for Brazil.
end note

API_GATEWAY <-- IAM: Return redirect
INGRESS <-- API_GATEWAY: Return redirect
PSU <-- INGRESS: Redirect Customer

alt Account Information

note right of TPP

---
The retrieval of account data happens in two stages:

1. The TPP requests the available resources at the Resources API.
2. Using the identifiers returned they can request account data.
end note

group Get all resource identifiers

note right of TPP
The TPP will require the ""RESOURCES_READ"" permission to access
the ""/resources"" endpoint. If Customer has not consented to this
the request should be rejected (not shown here).
end note

note right of TPP
In this example the TPP only has access to checking accounts.

the ""/accounts/v1/accounts/{accountId}"" endpoint. If Customer
has not consented to this the request should be rejected (not
shown here).
end note

INGRESS -> API_GATEWAY: ""POST /payments/v1/pix/payments""

note right of API_GATEWAY
The approach to Access Token introspection remains the same under payments
i.e. the API Gateway will need an assertion that indicates the consent granted
by the Customer matches the payment being instructed.
end note

then be forwarded to the API Builder application and used to make the correct
payment instruction in the Banking Systems.
